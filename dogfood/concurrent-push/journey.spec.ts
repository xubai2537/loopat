/**
 * concurrent-push — git push CONFLICT RESOLUTION, head-on.
 *
 * The legitimacy test for shared loops: two writers race the SAME branch
 * (`master`) of the SAME origin (the fixture `roster1.git`). The loop is the
 * SECOND writer, so its first push is REJECTED non-fast-forward and it must
 * fetch + rebase + re-push to land its work on top of the other writer's.
 * "Last one resolves." This does NOT avoid the conflict — it forces one and
 * resolves it the standard git way.
 *
 * Flow:
 *   1. Create a loop from roster1; open the terminal; wait container running +
 *      PreparingOverlay clear.
 *   2. In the loop's UI terminal (xterm, fish): set git identity, commit a
 *      Z-BASE state and push it so loop + origin start in sync.
 *   3. Advance origin from OUTSIDE the loop (podman exec into the fixture): clone
 *      roster1.git, commit Y on master, push it back. Origin now has Y the loop
 *      doesn't.
 *   4. In the loop terminal: commit Z on the (now-stale) base and push → it is
 *      REJECTED non-fast-forward. We prove the rejection by STATE: the fixture
 *      origin's tip must STILL be Y (Z did NOT land yet).
 *   5. In the loop terminal: fetch + rebase onto origin/master, push again →
 *      succeeds.
 *   6. INTEGRATION TRUTH: roster1.git log --oneline shows BOTH Y AND Z — the
 *      conflict was resolved, last writer rebased on top, both landed.
 *
 * No chat message is ever sent → zero AI tokens. We drive the real UI terminal
 * (xterm, fish shell — every command is fish-valid) and verify every outcome via
 * integration truth (`podman exec ... git`), never by scraping the flaky xterm.
 *
 * The harness (dogfood/playwright.config.ts + setup.ts) already booted the real
 * stack and preconfigured the `test` user ALREADY ONBOARDED with the anthropic
 * provider and roster repo roster1. We arrive logged in via storageState.
