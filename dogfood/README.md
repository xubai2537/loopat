# dogfood — real-stack e2e

These tests boot a **real** loopat stack (isolated `LOOPAT_HOME`, real backend,
real podman sandbox, real fixture git origin over ssh) and drive it through a
real browser. No mocks. They catch integration bugs that the logic tests in
`e2e/` cannot — workdir gitdir paths, empty repos page, config-hash drift, ssh
key naming, real AI turns, real pushes to origin. If the stack can't actually
run, a dogfood test **fails — it never skips green**.

They cost a (small) real AI key spend, so they are organized into four tiers by
cost and intent.

## Tiers

### smoke — fast, run on every change
The shared-fixture suite presets an ALREADY-ONBOARDED user and reuses one
backend, so it's the cheapest way to know the critical path still works.

| Case | Answers |
|------|---------|
| `first-5-minutes` | Can a fresh user create a loop, get a real AI reply, and `git push` from the terminal to origin — in the first five minutes? |

Run: `bun run dogfood:smoke`

### journey — full cold-start, run before a release
The whole first-time-user flow from a TRULY EMPTY `LOOPAT_HOME`, driven entirely
through the browser (register → onboarding gate → personal repo + git-crypt →
ssh pubkey → context → loop → AI → terminal). Ends with BOTH an AI push and a
human push reaching origin, per the doctrine that origin is the source of truth.

| Case | Answers |
|------|---------|
| `first-run` | Does the complete cold-start onboarding work end to end, and do both "AI done" and "human done" really land in origin? |

Run: `bun run dogfood:journey`

### scenario — focused / regression, run when touching the relevant area
Each isolates one behavior on the shared-fixture stack.

| Case | Answers |
|------|---------|
| `repos-page` | Does the repos page render the user's roster from real provider state? |
| `second-loop-warm` | Is a second loop on the same repo fast (warm mirror, fetch + worktree, no re-clone)? |
| `attach-detach` | Does detaching/re-attaching a loop recreate the container on config-hash drift? |
| `context-notes-sync` | Does a loop push its notes worktree to origin? |
| `concurrent-push` | Do concurrent pushes from multiple loops converge on origin without loss? |
| `multi-turn-task` | Does a real multi-turn AI tool-use turn complete and verify against integration truth? |

Run the full scenario preset (the 7 shared-fixture cases): `bun run dogfood`

### sync — two-server context flow, run before a release
Two fully independent loopat servers (each its own `LOOPAT_HOME`/backend/vite/
user/vault) sharing ONE fixture git origin. Proves the docs/context-flow.md
claim that across-server and on-one-server multi-user are the same mechanism:
every edit converges on the shared SoT.

| Case | Answers |
|------|---------|
| `sync` (S0–S5) | A edits → origin → B sees it (UI loop, AI loop, shared kn, concurrent different files, and same-file held-back) — across two independent servers? |

Run: `bun run dogfood:sync`

## Running

All tiers need a real AI key in the environment (never read from disk, never
committed):

```sh
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=$(cat ~/.loopat/personal/<you>/.loopat/vaults/default/envs/ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
```

`dogfood:journey` (first-run) additionally needs the AI provider base url:

```sh
export FIRST_RUN_AI_BASE_URL=https://api.anthropic.com
```

Then:

```sh
bun run dogfood:smoke      # first-5-minutes (fast)
bun run dogfood            # the 7 shared-fixture scenario cases
bun run dogfood:journey    # first-run full cold-start (release)
bun run dogfood:sync       # two-server context flow S0–S5 (release)
```

`dogfood:sync` additionally needs `FIRST_RUN_AI_BASE_URL`.

Preconditions are enforced at config load (fail, never skip): `podman`,
`git-crypt` (journey only), and the required env vars must all be present.

## Case layout — one subdir per case

Every case is its own directory with a `README.md` (purpose, steps, expectation)
and a `journey.spec.ts`. New browser+AI journeys live in `<name>/` and run
via `bun run dogfood:journeys`. Suites with their own globalSetup keep their own
config (`first-run`, `sync`, `subagent-model`).

### Browser+AI journeys (`*/`, `bun run dogfood:journeys`)
| Case | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| reply | AI replies with a deterministic token in the chat UI |
| memory | cross-turn context: 2nd turn recalls 1st-turn fact |
| tooluse | AI writes a file, proven via sandbox podman exec |
| rename | rename keeps chat history |
| twoloops | two loops stay isolated |
| gitcommit | AI commit verified by worktree git log |
| gitdiff | git-status API shows AI's uncommitted change |
| gitstage | git-stage API stages an AI-created file |
| restart | session restart keeps history + still replies |
| readfile | loop workdir is the seeded roster1 worktree |
| secondmsg | two sequential turns both reply |
| filestree | AI-created file appears in workdir listing |
| distill | distill returns a summary of a real turn |
| folder | AI creates a nested file (sandbox truth) |
| archive | archive hides loop from sidebar; restore returns it |
| multistep | one instruction chains read+write tools |
| interrupt | loop recovers after mid-turn interrupt |
| contextfiles | loop context endpoint responds |
| context | context freshness: cached records versions, snapshot reproduces |
| ai-extra | chat-history export + restart-session in one turn |

### Standalone suites (own config)
| Dir | Run |
|-----|-----|
| first-5-minutes | dogfood:smoke |
| first-run | dogfood:journey |
| sync | dogfood:sync |
| subagent-model | dogfood:subagent |
| attach-detach / concurrent-push / context-notes-sync / multi-turn-task / repos-page / second-loop-warm | dogfood |
